OOP

Map Real world things to Software design

1. Real world actors - Data in the memory (RAM) - Objects = Instance
	- class : Blueprint from where objects can be created
		: From a class, 1 to n objects can be created in the RAM
		: a class gives a data type to an object


2. Real world actor characteristics - Variables in the object = Instance variables

3. Real world actor actions - Methods called on the object
